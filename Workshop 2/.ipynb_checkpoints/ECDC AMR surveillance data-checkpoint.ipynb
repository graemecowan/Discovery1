    "# Workshop 2: Antimicrobial resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"freestocks-nss2eRzQwgw-unsplash.jpg\" style=\"float: right;\" width=\"300\" >Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microorganisms develop the ability to survive exposure to antimicrobial drugs. This means that these drugs are no longer effective at killing or controlling the growth of the resistant microorganisms, which can lead to serious infections in humans and animals. \n",
    "\n",
    "AMR is a global public health threat as it can lead to the spread of untreatable diseases and increase the risk of outbreaks. EARS-Net (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network) is a surveillance network  that monitors AMR in bacteria that cause infections in humans, under the coordination of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). \n",
    "\n",
    "EARS-Net collects data on a range of bacterial pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as on the susceptibility of these bacteria to various antimicrobial drugs. The data is collected from a network of laboratories across the EU and is analyzed by the ECDC to generate annual reports on the status of AMR in the EU.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will use Python programming to analyse data from EARS-Net to help us understand the magnitude of the problem of AMR, and to see how the prevalence of AMR has changed over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intended Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe how AMR prevalence has changed within Europe over the past decade, and how AMR prevalence differs geographically. \n",
    "* Import filter and select data using the Pandas module in Python\n",
    "* Write code to produce appropriate graphs using the Seaborn module in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working as a group\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will analyse today is large - it contains AMR data for 8 bacterial species across 30 countries for 22 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should work together as a group:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Discuss your code, ideas and answers with other members of the group.** Peer assistance (not copying answers but talking through your approaches to the problem) can help avoid you getting stuck, increase how much you learn from the session and make it more enjoyable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Co-ordinate your analyses.** Split the more involved tasks between the group: select different countries and organisms to look at and compare what you observe. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Final task\n",
    "\n",
    "* **As a group** Assemble a single figure that illustrates the problem of antimicrobial resistance. That figure may have individual subplots if you wish\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Individual work** Upload the figure to Pebblepad. Write a paragraph to accompany the figure your group produced. Explain current status of AMR in Europe and what your figure indicates regarding the need for the development of new antimicrobials and the better management of current ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Saving figures to disk** \n",
    "\n",
    "You will want to save your figures as JPG, PNG or PDF files. To do this you can use the command `plt.savefig(\"my_plot.png\")`. Replace the file extension with 'jpg' or 'pdf' to produce those types of files.\n"
