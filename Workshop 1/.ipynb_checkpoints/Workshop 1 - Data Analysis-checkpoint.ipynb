    "A soil texture ternary plot is a graphical representation of the relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay in a soil sample. These three components are considered the main indicators of soil texture and are used to classify soils into different texture classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The plot is arranged in the shape of a triangle, with the three corners representing sand, silt, and clay, respectively. Each point within the triangle represents a unique combination of the three components, and the relative position of a point within the triangle indicates the relative proportions of the components in the soil sample. This type of plot is often used in soil science to quickly and easily visualize the texture of a soil sample.\n",
